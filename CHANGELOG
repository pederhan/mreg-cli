## [Unreleased]

The big Pydantic update. The entire codebase has been rewritten to use Pydantic for request and response validation. This brings with it a huge improvement to the development experience and the robustness of the code.

### Added

- `--version` option to display current version and exit. 
    Version number is in the form of `major.minor.patch` if installed from a published version.
    Shows a version number including the commit hash if installed from a git repository in the form of `major.minor.patch.dev123+gabc1234`.
    See [Default versioning scheme](https://setuptools-scm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/#default-versioning-scheme) in the [setuptools_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) documentation for more information.
- `label set_description` command to set the description of a label.
- `network list_excluded_ranges` command to list the excluded ranges of a network.
- Application can now store tokens for multiple servers and will pick the correct one based on the server URL.


### Changed

- The application now uses Pydantic internally to validate request and response data. This should make the code more robust and easier to maintain.
- `label rename` no longer takes a `-desc` option. Description modification is now done with the `label set_description` command.
- Application now attempts to send JSON for every request. This should improve the consistency of the API responses.

### Fixed

- Hopefully more than we broke.
